# madlibs-lab

#### Here you will create a simple madlibs game. 
#### Read more about madlibs here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mad_Libs

### Instructions

####  Start with the index.html, which has several input elements and a button.
#### Create a JavaScript file and call it "script.js".
#### Link index.html to index.js using `script` tag.
#### Add an event listener to the button so that it calls a makeMadLib function when clicked.
#### In the makeMadLib function, retrieve the current values of the form input elements, make a story from them, and output that in the story div (like "Pamela really likes pink cucumbers.")
